# 🐟 FishML

**FishML** is a machine learning project aimed at diagnosing fish diseases through image classification. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project seeks to assist fish owners and aquaculture professionals in early detection and treatment of fish ailments.

## 📌 Project Overview

The primary goal of FishML is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of fish as either healthy or diseased. This tool can be instrumental in:

- **Early Disease Detection**: Prompt identification of diseases to initiate timely treatment.
- **Aquaculture Management**: Assisting fish farmers in monitoring the health of their stock.
- **Educational Purposes**: Serving as a learning resource for those interested in machine learning applications in aquaculture.

## 🧠 Features

- **Image Classification**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks to differentiate between healthy and diseased fish.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Extensibility**: Modular code structure allows for easy updates and integration of additional features.

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VarunP2304/FishML.git
   cd FishML
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.*

## 📂 Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset comprising images of both healthy and diseased fish. To use the dataset:

1. **Download the Dataset**: [Provide link or instructions here]

2. **Organize the Dataset**:
   - Place healthy fish images in a folder named `healthy/`.
   - Place diseased fish images in a folder named `diseased/`.

   The directory structure should look like:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── healthy/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── diseased/
       ├── image1.jpg
       ├── image2.jpg
       └── ...
   ```

3. **Update Dataset Path**: Modify the dataset path in the code as needed to reflect the location on your system.

## 🚀 Usage

To train and evaluate the model:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FishML_reimagined.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the Steps in the Notebook**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the convolutional neural network model.
   - Evaluate model performance on test data.
   - Use the model to make predictions on new images.
